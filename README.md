A Planner's Guide Website
=========================

About
-----

I'm a planner who is interested in the intersection of planning and technology. For the longest time now I have wanted to learn more about how web technologies can be leveraged for planning purposes. Being a technology nerd I've found a ton of great websites and web apps that can be used for planning, but something was missing. I lacked the skills and understanding to be able to take these resources and apply them to existing planning processes. 

So I decided that I needed a better grounding in the technologies (html, css, javascript, php, ruby) fueling the websites and applications I saw online. Luckily my [local public library rocks] (http://chattlibrary.org/) and they provide free access to [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) training. As I have been learning I have realized that I need a place where I can apply what I've been learning in the real world. This website is that place. 

The Plan
--------

I plan on creating a website about how technology can be better used for planning from scratch. I will start with a blank index.html and style.css file and go from there. I'm completely new to all this and have zero programming background so this could get interesting.
